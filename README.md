# A fork of Chatbot UI Lite using Langchain to further simplify it
I will also try to add some extra features to it, such as long term memory(done), task management(done somewhat), and note-taking in the additional-features branch

USE ADDITIONAL-FEATURES BRANCH FOR MOST EXTRA FEATURES, MAIN(SPECIFICALLY APRIL 21 COMMIT) FOR BARE BONES FEATURES ONLY

### To - do not in any order:
 - Web browsing
 - more sustainable and cost effective memory(currently tokenizing all message history each time)
 - import and export data
 - notes
 - viewing lists
 - better API key auth
